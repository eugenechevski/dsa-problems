Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
    * a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

 
Example 1:
    Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    Output: true

Example 2:
    Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
    Output: false

Example 3:
    Input: root = []
    Output: true

Constraints:
    * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
    * -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
