Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionallyÂ surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example 1:
    Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
    Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
    Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
    - It is on the border, or
    - It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
    The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
    The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

Example 2:
    Input: board = [["X"]]
    Output: [["X"]]

Constraints:
    * m == board.length
    * n == board[i].length
    * 1 <= m, n <= 200
    * board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
