    The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
    Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

    Example 1:
        Input: x = 1, y = 4
        Output: 2
        Explanation:
        1   (0 0 0 1)
        4   (0 1 0 0)

        The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

    Example 2:
        Input: x = 3, y = 1
        Output: 1

    Constraints:
        * 0 <= x, y <= 2^(31 - 1)
